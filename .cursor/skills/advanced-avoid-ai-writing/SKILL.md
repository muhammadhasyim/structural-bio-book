# Advanced — Avoid AI Writing (composed skill)

This skill **stacks on** the project skill **`avoid-ai-writing`** (`.cursor/skills/avoid-ai-writing/SKILL.md`). Apply that skill’s modes (`rewrite` / `detect`), severity tiers (P0–P2), context profiles, and output format **first**. Use this file to add a second pass informed by Wikipedia’s community-maintained field guide for undisclosed AI text.

## When to invoke advanced

- The draft reads “encyclopedic” or promotional in a hollow way (significance, legacy, ecosystem, tourism-brochure tone).
- You see **Wikipedia- or LLM-tool artifacts**: Markdown where wikitext is expected, `turn0search0`, broken citation tokens (`oaicite`, `contentReference`, `+1`), fake shortcuts, “as of my knowledge cutoff,” collaborative filler (“happy to help”), or notability argued as a list of outlets instead of substance.
- You need **comment / talk-page** tells: canned policy language, offers for feedback, wikilawyering templates, emoji-as-formatting.
- The user explicitly wants the **Wikipedia signs** checklist in addition to the tiered vocabulary tables.

The **full Wikipedia field guide** is included in the appendix at the end of this file (after the horizontal rule). It is **descriptive, not prescriptive**: many patterns also appear in human writing; use judgment.

## Second-pass checklist (cross-walk)

After finishing `avoid-ai-writing`, scan for these **extra** clusters from the Wikipedia guide (general prose first; skip wiki-only rows when not editing wikitext).

| Area | What to flag or fix |
|------|---------------------|
| **Regression to the mean** | Specific facts replaced by generic praise; subject gets vaguer and louder at once. Prefer concrete names, numbers, dates, mechanisms. |
| **Significance / legacy** | “Pivotal moment,” “testament,” “underscores,” “broader movement,” “evolving landscape,” “indelible mark,” “deeply rooted,” “setting the stage.” |
| **Notability theater** | Lists of outlets without what they said; “independent coverage,” “high-quality secondary,” “active social media presence,” “strong digital presence.” |
| **Superficial analysis** | Trailing `-ing` commentary (“highlighting… ensuring… reflecting… contributing…”); “valuable insights”; “align/resonate with.” |
| **Promotional / travel-brochure** | “Nestled,” “vibrant,” “rich cultural heritage,” “natural beauty,” “gateway to,” “seamlessly,” “showcasing,” “commitment to.” |
| **Weasel attributions** | “Experts argue,” “observers have cited,” “industry reports,” “several sources” with thin cites. Name the source or drop the frame. |
| **Outline conclusions** | “Challenges and opportunities,” “looking ahead,” “future prospects” as generic closers. |
| **Copula avoidance** | Same as base skill — Wikipedia calls out avoiding plain “is/are”; prefer direct copulas when accurate. |
| **Negative parallelisms** | “Not just X but Y,” “not X, but Y” overused. |
| **Rule of three & elegant variation** | Triads everywhere; thesaurus-driven synonym rotation. |
| **Style** | Title case creep, bold spam, em-dash density, inline-header bullet walls, curly quotes where inconsistent with house style, arbitrary thematic breaks. |
| **User-directed / chat residue** | Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers, “let me know if,” phrasal templates, collaborative hedging. |
| **Citations & links** | Broken URLs, bogus DOIs, `utm_source=`, citations that do not support the sentence (especially after RAG). |

For **wikitext, AFC, permissions, and comment-specific** sections, use the **appendix** when the user’s artifact is Wikipedia or wiki-like.

## Modes and output

- Inherit **`rewrite` / `detect`** from `avoid-ai-writing` (same triggers).
- In **rewrite** mode: append a short **“Wikipedia-style tells”** subsection to your summary listing any extra issues from the table above (or “none”).
- In **detect** mode: add **“Wikipedia-field-guide flags”** with quoted spans and note wiki-only vs generally applicable.

## Licensing

- **Instructions and checklist above** (through “Modes and output”): MIT, same spirit as the sibling `avoid-ai-writing` skill.
- **Appendix** (everything after the next horizontal rule): text from [Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing); **CC BY-SA 4.0**; list of contributors on the article’s *View history*. Do not strip the attribution HTML comment at the start of the appendix body.

Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing

This is an [advice page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Guide#Advice_pages) from [WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup).

This page is not a [Wikipedia policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines), as it has not been [reviewed by the community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus#Levels_of_consensus).

LLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.

This is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of [AI chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_chatbot) such as [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT), with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles, drafts, comments, and other content. It is a [field guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_guide) to help detect [undisclosed AI-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LLMDISCLOSE) on Wikipedia: while some of the signs may be broadly applicable, some may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context. Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including Wikipedia. Many elements of AI writing can be found in editorials, blogs, or fan fiction.

Moreover, this list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid can be found in the [policies and guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PAG) and the [Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MOS), but does not belong on this page.

The patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry [much more serious policy risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIFAIL). Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at [Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models#Handling_suspected_LLM-generated_content) and [Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup/Guide).

The [speedy deletion policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Speedy_deletion) criterion [G15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:G15)(LLM-generated pages without human review) lists some signs of AI writing, but is limited to the most objective ones. The remaining signs covered here are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.

## Caveats

### AI detection tools

Do not solely rely on [artificial intelligence content detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_content_detection) tools (such as [GPTZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPTZero)). While they perform better than random chance, these tools have non-trivial error rates. Detectors can be susceptible to factors such as text modifications (e.g. paraphrasing, markup, and spacing changes) and the use of models not seen during detector training.

### Your detection ability

| Test your AI detection skills at [Wikipedia:AI or not quiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AI_or_not_quiz). |
| --- |

Do not rely too much on your own judgment. While research on humans' abilities to detect AI-generated text is limited, a 2025 preprint shows that heavy users of LLMs can correctly determine whether an article was generated by AI about 90% of the time, which means that if you are an expert user of LLMs and you tag 10 pages as being AI-generated, you've probably made one false positive. People who don't use LLMs much do only slightly better than random chance (in both directions).

It is also worth noting that writers may adjust their behavior to avoid accusations of AI, or may be defensive about using AI tropes.

## Content

LLMs (and [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to [regress to the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_to_the_mean); that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a "tell" for detecting AI-generated content.

For example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the highly specific "inventor of the first train-coupling device" might become "a revolutionary titan of industry". It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.

This statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.

### Undue emphasis on significance, legacy, and broader trends

| Words to watch: stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted, ... |
| --- |

LLM writing often [puffs up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Puffery) the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic. There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.

The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. [...]

The founding of Idescat represented a significant shift toward regional statistical independence, enabling [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia) to develop a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

— From [this September 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1252053288) to [Statistical Institute of Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Institute_of_Catalonia)

Kumba has long been an important center for trade and agriculture. [...] The establishment of road networks connecting Kumba to other parts of the Southwest Region, such as Mamfe and Buea, helped solidify its role as a regional hub.

— From [this October 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1248482444) to [Kumba, Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumba,_Cameroon)

LLMs may include these statements for even the most mundane of subjects like etymology or population data. Sometimes, they add hedging preambles acknowledging that the subject is relatively unimportant or low-profile, before talking about its importance anyway.

Examples

During the [Spanish colonial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Colonial_Period_(Philippines)), the name Bakunutan was hispanized to Bacnotan, a modification reflected in official documents preserved in the [National Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_the_Philippines) in Manila. This etymology highlights the enduring legacy of the community's resistance and the transformative power of unity in shaping its identity.

— From [this December 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1265870147) to [Bacnotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacnotan)

When talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss an animal or plant species), LLMs tend to over-emphasize connections to the broader ecosystem or environment, even when those connections are tenuous or generic. LLMs also tend to belabor the species' conservation status and research and preservation efforts, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.

Examples

Currently, there is no specific conservation assessment for Lethrinops lethrinus by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the general health of the Lake Malawi ecosystem is crucial for the survival of this and other endemic species. Factors such as overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction could potentially impact their populations.

— From [this July 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1235454313) to [Lethrinops lethrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethrinops_lethrinus)

It plays a role in the ecosystem and contributes to Hawaii's rich cultural heritage. [...] Preserving this endemic species is vital not only for ecological diversity but also for sustaining the cultural traditions connected to Hawaii’s native flora.

— From [this December 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1262033910) to [Nototrichium divaricatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nototrichium_divaricatum)

### Canned emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage

| Words to watch: independent coverage, local/regional/national/[country name] media outlets, music/business/tech outlets, profiled in, written by a leading expert, active social media presence |
| --- |

Similarly, LLMs act as if the best way to prove that a subject is notable is to hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often by listing sources that a subject has been covered in. They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own [superficial analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Superficial_analyses) to the source. This is more common in text from newer AI tools (2025 or later).

Human-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact wording of [Wikipedia's guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N), such as "independent coverage."

Examples

She spoke about AI on CNN, and was featured in Vogue, Wired, Toronto Star, and other media. [...] Her insights have also been featured in *Wired*, *Refinery29*, and other prominent media outlets.

— From [this February 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1276225083) to [Sinead Bovell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinead_Bovell)(also note the [use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown) of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown))

Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu.

— From [this April 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1285114966) to [Shamika Ravi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamika_Ravi)

Its significance is documented in archived school event programs and regional press coverage, including the *Mesabi Daily News*, which regularly reviewed performances held there.

— From [this June 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1294930957) to [Virginia High School (Minnesota)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_High_School_(Minnesota))(also note the [use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown) of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown))

The subject has been profiled in multiple high-quality, independent, and widely-read outlets, including The Australian, SBS News, 7News, and coverage syndicated through the Associated Press—appearing in platforms like The Senior and Perth Now. These sources provide significant, substantial, secondary coverage, not trivial mentions or press releases.

---

• Repeated national media coverage for both professional and advocacy work (reported by SBS, 7News, The Australian, etc.) • Leadership roles in international and national health campaigns (e.g., THINK Aorta ANZ and board member of Hearts4Heart) • National ambassador role for the National Heart Foundation of Australia, highlighted by multiple independent reports • Academic and economic contributions recognised by universities, specialist publications, and health system institutions (e.g., University of Sydney, Monash University, RANZCR) • Ongoing public presence in respected media and at speaking events over multiple years, including via independent news commentary, landmark survival stories, and national health initiatives Together, these factors clearly demonstrate significant, sustained, and verifiable coverage—meeting both WP:BIOSIGand WP:SIGCOV.

— From [this November 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1320014555) to [Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Help_desk)(note that [WP:BIOSIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BIOSIG?action=edit&redlink=1) is [not a real shortcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AISHORTCUT))

On Wikipedia specifically, LLMs often painstakingly emphasize their sources in the body text—even for trivial coverage, uncontroversial facts, or other situations where a human Wikipedia editor would be more likely to either provide an inline citation or no source at all.

Examples

The restaurant has also been mentioned in [ABC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News_(Australia)) coverage relating to incidents in the surrounding precinct, underscoring its role as a well-known late-night venue in the city [of [Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide)].

— Trivial coverage with attribution, from [this August 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1305163154) to [The Original Pancake Kitchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Original_Pancake_Kitchen); the reference added for this sentence did not exist.

In articles about people or entities that use social media, LLMs will often note that they "maintain an active social media presence" or something similar. This wording is particularly idiosyncratic to AI text and relatively uncommon on Wikipedia before ~2024.

Examples

The mall maintains a strong digital presence, particularly on Instagram, where it actively shares the latest updates and events. Forum Kochi has consistently demonstrated excellence in digital promotions, with high-quality, engaging, and impactful video content playing a key role in its outreach.

— From [this June 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1297291381) to [Forum Mall Kochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Mall_Kochi)

In some cases, LLMs will create entire sections to assert notability, with a breakdown of the sources that have covered the topic in a list format. This is in contrast to how most articles are written — summarizing the content that sources publish, then citing them as footnotes.

Examples

Media coverage

- **IRNA** – Coverage of his inter-city marathon events.
- **ISNA** – Report on an 80 km provincial peace run.
- **IFRC** – Feature on his humanitarian campaigns.
- **Fars News** – Interview on his national running projects.
- **Varzesh3** – Report on a 17-day endurance run.
- **Borna News** – Profile on his athletic background.

— From a December 2025 version of [Draft:Mojtaba Yadegari (Iranian runner)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&oldid=1326136318)

### Superficial analyses

| Words to watch: highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing ..., ensuring ..., reflecting/symbolizing ..., contributing to ..., cultivating/fostering ..., encompassing ..., valuable insights, align/resonate with, |
| --- |

AI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact. This is often done by attaching a [present participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle#Forms)("-ing") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with [vague attributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIWEASEL) to third parties (see below).

For the purpose of Wikipedia, such comments are usually [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SYNTH) or unattributed opinions. Newer chatbots with [retrieval-augmented generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation)(for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) may attach these statements to [named sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Undue_emphasis_on_notability,_attribution,_and_media_coverage)—e.g., "Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence"—regardless of whether those sources say anything close.

Examples

As of the April 2008 census, the population of Douera stood at approximately 56,998 inhabitants, creating a lively community within its borders. Situated in the central-north region of the country, Douera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture. With its coastal charm and convenient location, Douera captivates both residents and visitors alike, offering a diverse range of experiences against the backdrop of Algeria's stunning natural beauty.

— From [this June 2023 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&diff=1161677884&oldid=) to [Douéra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou%C3%A9ra)

It holds a pivotal place in the [East Central Railway Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Central_Railway_Zone) of [Indian Railways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railways), serving as a major railway hub with historical significance. The station has [1,676 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_ft_6_in_gauge_railway)(5 ft 6 in) [broad gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_gauge) along with 8 tracks and 6 platforms. [...] Historically, it has been crucial for linking [Darbhanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbhanga) with significant cities like [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi), [Patna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna), and [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), facilitating the movement of passengers and goods. The station has supported various services, including passenger trains and express trains like the [Satyagrah Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagrah_Express) and [Mithila Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithila_Express), contributing to the socio-economic development of the region. [...] Over the years, Darbhanga Junction has seen several upgrades and modernization efforts aimed at improving facilities and operational efficiency, reflecting its continued relevance in the regional and national transportation landscape.

The civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice. This historical legacy has influenced contemporary African-American families, shaping their values, community structures, and approaches to political engagement. Economically, the enduring impacts of systemic inequality have led to both challenges and innovations within African-American communities, driving a commitment to empowerment and social change that echoes through generations.

Situated just a few miles from the U.S.-Mexico border—a line that often represents separation and division—the temple stands as a counter-symbol, emphasizing unity, togetherness, and transcendent faith. In a region where many families and communities span both countries, the temple fosters a sense of connection and shared purpose. Through its inclusive design and symbolic features, the McAllen Texas Temple is seen as a bridge across divides, embodying the spirit of unity that underlies its sacred purpose. Its bilingual monument sign, with inscriptions in both English and Spanish, underscores its role in bringing together Latter-day Saints from the United States and Mexico.

The temple’s architectural and decorative elements are thoughtfully imbued with local symbolism, reflecting the rich culture and landscape of the Rio Grande Valley. Citrus blossom motifs, seen throughout the exterior and interior, celebrate the area’s agricultural roots and its vital citrus industry. The temple’s color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region’s natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes. These colors and patterns evoke enduring faith and resilience, qualities that resonate deeply within this close-knit, cross-border community.

In design and structure, the McAllen Texas Temple honors the Spanish colonial heritage that has historically shaped the area. By incorporating these architectural elements, the temple connects to both the Latin American influences and the historic roots of the border region, creating a space where the past and present come together.

These works are now part of the **Collections of the National Museum of Education - Réseau Canopé (France)**, highlighting their historical and pedagogical significance.

His influence persists in more recent studies. In 2010, Les néologismes dans l'hebdomadaire L'Express (1980) was cited in the Proceedings of the 1st International Congress on Neology in Romance Languages [...] demonstrating the ongoing relevance of his research on lexical evolution. [...] In 2004, the Cahiers de lexicologie (issues 84-87), published by the [CNRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_National_Centre_for_Scientific_Research), cited the Grammaire Blois, confirming its relevance in modern research. [...]

These citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic publications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and neology.

Fridrichová analyzes the distinction made by Blois and Bar between acronyms, abbreviations, and truncations, emphasizing their critical view on the impact of truncations in the French language.

[...]

Fridrichová highlights that Blois and Bar perceive truncations as a **distortion of the language rather than an enrichment**, a perspective that still fuels linguistic debates today. This citation demonstrates the **enduring relevance of Blois's work in modern linguistic studies** and its **critical reception by researchers**.

AI chatbots occasionally claim that certain things or actions have resulted in discussions about related concepts.

The phenomenon has generated debate about authenticity, consent, and the psychological effects of digitally extending personhood.

LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone. Even when prompted to use an encyclopedic tone, and even when editors have no [promotional interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:COI) in a topic, their output will often tend toward advertisement-like writing, or like the prose of a travel guide. This may happen when generating new text or rewriting existing text; they often insert promotional language while claiming they removed it.

Note: Not all promotional or spammy writing is AI-generated. LLMs tend to over-use the same set of promotional phrases no matter what the topic. Also, older LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) tend to output more [blatantly positive text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19556) than newer LLMs, which are more likely to be subtly positive.

#### Subtypes

When writing about something that could be considered "cultural heritage" (even Japan's electronics industry), LLMs [constantly remind the reader of its importance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Undue_emphasis_on_significance,_legacy,_and_broader_trends).

Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the unique characteristics that make Alamata Raya Kobo a town worth visiting and shed light on its significance within the Amhara region.

The SOLLEI’s exterior design communicates a powerful emotional presence, staying true to Cadillac's signature bold proportions. Its low, elongated silhouette is highlighted by a wide stance and an extended coupe door, which enhances accessibility to the spacious rear cabin. Smooth, uninterrupted surfaces and a pronounced A-line accentuate the vehicle’s overall length, while a sleek, low tail imparts a sense of refined dynamism. A mid-body line runs seamlessly from the headlamps to the taillights, reinforcing the car’s cohesive and elegant design. Traditional door handles have been replaced with discrete buttons, preserving the vehicle’s clean and modern profile. In a nod to Cadillac’s legacy of bold color choices, the exterior is finished in "Manila Cream"—a distinctive hue originally offered in 1957 and 1958. This heritage color has been thoughtfully revived and hand-painted by Cadillac artisans, showcasing the brand’s dedication to craftsmanship and historical reverence.

### Vague attributions and overgeneralization of opinions

| Words to watch: Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when only few sources are cited), such as (before exhaustive word lists), ... |
| --- |

AI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called [weasel wording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_wording).

Examples

Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Efforts are ongoing to monitor its ecological health and preserve the surrounding grassland environment, which is part of a larger initiative to protect China’s semi-arid ecosystems from degradation.

Because much of the historical record derives from [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa) chronicles, Bornu sources and oral tradition, modern researchers treat Kwararafa as a fluid political and cultural formation rather than a fixed state.

— From [this November 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1323819205) to [Kwararafa Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwararafa_Confederacy)

AI chatbots also commonly exaggerate the quantity of sources that these opinions are attributed to. They may present views from one or two sources as widely held (often combined with the vague attributions above), mention the existence or opinion of multiple "reviewers" or "scholars" while only citing one person, or imply that lists of examples are non-exhaustive when the sources give no indication that other examples exist.

Examples

### Outline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects

| Words to watch: Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook ... |
| --- |

Many LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a "Challenges" section, which typically begins with a sentence like "Despite its [positive/promotional words], [article subject] faces challenges..." and ends with either a vaguely positive assessment of the article subject, or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for "Future Prospects."

Note: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges or challenging.

### Leads treating Wikipedia lists or broad article titles as proper nouns

In AI-generated articles about topics with a title that is not a [proper name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_name), such as a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lists), the first sentence of the lead may introduce or define the article's title as if it were a standalone real-world entity. While the [MOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#Format_of_the_first_sentence) does allow such titles to be included at the beginning of the lead "in a natural way", these AI leads tend not to be so natural.

| --- |

Many studies have demonstrated that LLMs overuse specific words. These words started appearing far more frequently in text produced after 2022, when LLM chatbots became widely accessible, than similar text produced beforehand. They often co-occur in LLM output: where there is one, there are likely others. While most of these studies have analyzed scientific abstracts or fiction, "AI vocabulary" words are also ubiquitous in LLM-based encyclopedias, such as [Grokipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia), and in AI-generated Wikipedia text. One or two of these words appearing in an edit may be coincidental, but an edit (post-2022) introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells for AI use.

The distribution of "AI vocabulary" is slightly different depending on which chatbot or LLM was used, and has changed over time. For instance, the word [delve](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/delve) was famously overused by ChatGPT in 2023 and early 2024, but became less frequent later in 2024, then dropped off sharply in 2025. Below is a breakdown of which words frequently recur together during which LLM "era." While these are not hard cutoffs, they should give you a rough idea of how "earlier" vs "later" LLM output reads.

- 2023 to mid-2024 (GPT-4): Additionally, boasts, bolstered, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, garner, intricate/intricacies, interplay, key, landscape, meticulous/meticulously, pivotal, underscore, tapestry, testament, valuable, vibrant
- Mid-2024 to mid-2025 (GPT-4o): align with, bolstered, crucial, emphasizing, enhance, enduring, fostering, highlighting, pivotal, showcasing, underscore, vibrant
- Mid-2025 and on (GPT-5): emphasizing, enhance, highlighting, showcasing (plus words associated with ["Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Undue_emphasis_on_notability,_attribution,_and_media_coverage))

Please keep context in mind. For example, while the figurative use of "underscore" is ubiquitous in earlier AI text, the word can also refer to a literal underline mark or to [incidental music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidental_music).

Examples

The inscriptions also offer valuable insights into the construction of the mosque. They record the names of the key craftsmen involved, including Mason Ahmad b. Muhammad, known as Haddad (the smith or iron-worker), and Hjajji Muhammad, the tile-cutter from [Tabriz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz). These names highlight the collaborative nature of mosque construction and emphasize the contributions of skilled artisans. [...] For example, the repeated invocation of the names of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams in Kufic script highlights the Shi'ite character of the mosque and links its construction to the broader context of the Ilkhanid state's official adoption of Shi'ism under [Oljeitu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96ljait%C3%BC). [...] This inscription, commissioned during the reign of the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Uzun Hasan, also underscores the enduring practice of pious patronage for mosque upkeep and renovation.

Somali cuisine is an intricate and diverse fusion of a multitude of culinary influences, drawing from the rich tapestry of [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_cuisine), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine), and [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine) flavours.

When prompted to provide a response to the placement of an {{ [AI-generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AI-generated)}} tag on an article, AI chatbots tend to use the word "concrete" as an adjective. This is often the case in comments that emphasize the apparent [lack of "concrete evidence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOPROOFOFAI) of AI use or are requests for accusers to [provide "concrete examples"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WHERESTHEAI) of text that appears AI-generated.

Examples

### Avoidance of basic copulatives ("is"/"are" phrases)

| Words to watch: serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/maintains/offers [a] |
| --- |

LLM-generated text often substitutes simpler constructions that use [copulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)) such as is or are for constructions like serves as a or mark the. One study documented an over 10% decrease in the usage of the words is and are in academic writing in 2023, with no major changes in their frequency before that. Similarly, LLMs prefer to use [marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BUZZ)-related verbs like features, offers, and the like to their neutral synonym has. (Note: This does not apply to has used in the [past participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_participle) form.) Sometimes these constructions are more elaborate, e.g., ventured into politics as a candidate versus was a candidate.

This is particularly visible in AI copyedits, which will often "improve" text in this way. The study above also demonstrated that when GPT-3.5 was prompted to "Revise the following sentence" in 10,000 abstracts, the words is and are appeared less often in the revised versions.

Note: This sign does not apply to Wikipedia leads (of the form "[Article subject] is..."); since LLMs are trained in part on Wikipedia, they have plenty of examples of leads to emulate.

### Negative parallelisms

When LLMs describe a subject, their output may seem as though it is clearing up a common misconception, or as though the audience may be reaching an incomplete or incorrect conclusion about that subject. This kind of contrast can come across as trying to retroactively challenge such thinking by pointing out another characteristic that the subject may possess alongside (or in the place of) one or more previously-mentioned characteristics. While it is common among human writers (especially in "common misconceptions" or "myths busted" [listicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle)), it is stereotypically an "AI sign."

#### Not just X, but also Y

It is common for LLMs to use parallel constructions involving "not", "but", or "however" such as "Not only ... but ..." or "It is not just ..., it's ...".

Examples

Self-Portrait by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.

— From [this April 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1288184349) to [Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-portrait_(Yayoi_Kusama))

I appreciate the feedback so far, but I want to clarify something that’s being overlooked. The issue here isn’t just sourcing—it’s framing. There’s a visible, growing movement around Northern English identity, documented across academic literature, social media, and grassroots activism. The fact that it doesn’t always use the exact phrase “Northern English nationalism” doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Movements evolve before they’re neatly labelled.

TikTok campaigns, dialect revival, and regional symbolism (like St Oswald’s stripes) are part of a broader cultural shift. Dismissing these as “not notable” or “original research” while allowing pages on Cornish nationalism, Wessex regionalism, and Yorkshire separatism suggests an inconsistency in how regional identity is treated. That’s not just a sourcing issue—it’s a systemic bias.

— From [this August 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1308162770) to [Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Northern English nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Northern_English_nationalism); this example also contains [em dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIDASH) and [curly quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AICURLY)

Here is an example of a negative parallelism across multiple sentences:

He hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.

— From [this April 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1284729136) to [Eugenio Duse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Duse)

#### Not X, but Y

Another common LLM pattern is parallelisms that explicitly state that a particular item doesn't possess the first characteristic at all. Such constructions are often expressed as "It's not ..., it's ..." or "no ..., no ..., just ...".

Examples

The viewer is presented with a self-image that is not grounded in visual mastery, but in what Amelia Jones terms “the performative enactment of subjectivity”.

[...]

This dispersal is not dissolution. Rather, it constitutes what Deleuze might describe as “becoming”—an identity in flux, constituted through iterative difference. Through this lens, Kusama’s self-portrait is not a mirror but a portal: not a representation of self, but a mechanism for its constant reinvention.

— From [this May 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1288356293) to [Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-portrait_(Yayoi_Kusama))

You say these sources “cover multiple events”? False. They echo the same viral incident and do it through a limited lens. This isn’t WP:NBIO — it’s WP:1EVENT in disguise, trying to wear a press badge like armor.

[...]

Now let’s talk BLP1E: This person is only in the news because of one isolated controversy. Not a career, not a body of work, not sustained relevance — just an algorithmic moment. And if we’re really upholding Wikipedia’s values, we don’t preserve pages built on the backs of virality alone, especially when it risks long-term harm to a living subject without lasting notability.

“Might as well get back on topic.”

Then let’s stay on topic, and the topic is not who feels warm fuzzies from visibility, it’s whether this article meets the threshold for inclusion. It doesn’t.

And finally — if you don’t want “a wall of text,” maybe don’t build a wall of shallow logic and expect people not to knock it down. This ain’t bludgeoning — it’s surgical teardown of a weak argument hiding behind fake neutrality.

### Rule of three

LLMs overuse the ' [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing))'. This can take different forms, from "adjective, adjective, adjective" to "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase". LLMs often use this structure to make [superficial analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Superficial_analyses) appear more comprehensive.

Examples

The Amaze Conference brings together global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing. The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities.

— From [Draft:Amaze Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Amaze_Conference)(2025)

### Elegant variation

Generative AI has a repetition-penalty code, meant to discourage it from reusing words too often. For instance, the output might give a main character's name and then repeatedly use a different synonym or related term (e.g., protagonist, key player, eponymous character) when mentioning it again. While some English instructors may expect their students to use elegant variation or avoid overusing a word, such usage may be discouraged in journalism. Editors of [The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian) have referred to such [elegant variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegant_variation) as "POVs" or "popular orange vegetables", mocking a draft of an article on carrots.

Note: If a user adds multiple pieces of AI-generated content in separate edits, this tell may not apply, as each piece of text may have been generated in isolation.

Examples

Soviet artistic constraints

Non-conformist artists

Their creativity

Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativity freely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. [...]

In this new chapter of his life, Yankilevsky found himself amidst a community of like-minded artists who, despite diverse styles, shared a common goal—to break free from the confines of state-imposed artistic norms, particularly socialist realism. [...]

The move to Paris facilitated an environment where Yankilevsky could further explore and exhibit his distinctive artistic vision without the constraints imposed by the Soviet regime. Dina Vierny's unwavering support and commitment to the Russian avant-garde artists played a crucial role in fostering a space where their creativity could flourish, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression in the vibrant cultural landscape of Paris. Vierny's commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition "Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.

### Overuse of boldface

AI chatbots may display various phrases in [boldface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldface) for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner. One of their tendencies, inherited from [readmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readme), fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a "key takeaways" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.

Examples

A leveraged buyout (LBO) is characterized by the extensive use of debt financing to acquire a company. This financing structure enables private equity firms and financial sponsors to control businesses while investing a relatively small portion of their own equity. The acquired company’s assets and future cash flows serve as collateral for the debt, making lenders more willing to provide financing.

Key Issues Requiring Community Review

1. Undue Weight and Apparent Bias The article places disproportionate emphasis on Netflix, exceeding its relevance to the subject and creating an imbalanced narrative. This raises ongoing concerns under [WP:NPOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV) and [WP:UNDUE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE).
2. News Aggregation and Excessive Detail Large portions of the article read as compiled news reporting, with dense, minimally summarized content that appears to be copied or lightly paraphrased from sources. This conflicts with WP:NOTNEWS and [WP:SUMMARYSTYLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SUMMARYSTYLE).
3. Lack of High-Level Overview The article fails to present a clear, concise overview of the proposed acquisition. Instead, readers are confronted with fragmented detail without sufficient contextual framing.
4. Misplacement of Content Speculative analysis, reporting detail, and tangential information are frequently placed in inappropriate sections, weakening article structure and reader comprehension.

Prior Cleanup Efforts

I have personally conducted substantial editing, including:

[...]

However, these efforts have not resolved the underlying issues, suggesting that individual edits alone are insufficient and that broader consensus and oversight are required.

Questions for Comment

I respectfully request community input on the following:

1. Does the article currently give undue weight to Netflix or other peripheral entities?
2. Is the article failing to meet [WP:NOTNEWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTNEWS) and [WP:SUMMARYSTYLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SUMMARYSTYLE) standards due to excessive, real-time reporting?
3. Does the article require structural reorganization to provide a proper overview and improve section relevance?
4. Would administrative measures (e.g., guided restructuring, closer monitoring, or temporary page protection) be appropriate given the article’s visibility and edit patterns?

Closing

Given the prominence of this topic and the likelihood of continued drive-by or promotional editing, this article requires careful scrutiny by experienced contributors. The goal of this RfC is to establish clear consensus on how the article should be structured, weighted, and maintained in line with Wikipedia’s core content policies.

Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Proposed_acquisition_of_Warner_Bros._Discovery); this example also includes [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AILIST) and uses [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AITITLECASE) for subheadings

### Inline-header vertical lists

AI chatbots output often includes vertical lists formatted in a specific way: an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header, separated with a colon from the remaining descriptive text.

Instead of [proper wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H:LIST), a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown)(#), [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Emoji_as_formatting), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as`1.`) instead of standard wikitext. When [copied as bare text appearing on the screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SCOPY), some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.

AVO consists of three key layers:

- SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Traditional methods for improving visibility in search engine results through content, technical, and on-page optimization.
- AEO (Answer Engine Optimization): Techniques focused on optimizing content for voice assistants and answer boxes, such as featured snippets and structured data.
- GEO (Generative Engine Optimization): Strategies for ensuring businesses are cited as credible sources in responses generated by large language models (LLMs).

Also note the [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AISIGNS#Rule_of_three).

Mass Content Removal: The user removed over 20,000 characters of reliably sourced content in a single edit, reducing the number of citations from 34 to 8, without any prior engagement on the Talk page.Disruptive Tagging: Despite the article being supported by 34 high-quality international secondary sources (Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Financial Times, etc.), the user implemented excessive "citation needed" tags as a form of visual vandalism to discredit the content.Refusal to engage (WP:BRD): The user was notified of WP:V and WP:DE policies on their talk page but has failed to justify these massive deletions, suggesting a coordinated attempt at de-legitimizing the subject.Context: Given the high-profile nature of the subject in global finance and mining (notably the AstraZeneca/EsoBiotec $1B M&A), the page is currently vulnerable to reputation-based sabotage.

### Overuse of em dashes

While human editors and writers often use [em dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash)(—), LLM output uses them more often than nonprofessional human-written text of the same genre, and uses them in places where humans are more likely to use commas, parentheses, colons, or (misused) hyphens (-) and [en dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_dash)(–). LLMs especially tend to use em dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking "punched up" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.

This sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself. It is much more common on discussion pages than in article text. Also, because LLMs' use of em-dashes has become somewhat notorious, some AI companies have attempted to make their newer chatbots suppress their use, most notably OpenAI's [GPT-5.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-5.1).

Examples

The term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people of the autonomous countries themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally and erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.

you're right about one thing — we do seem to have different interpretations of what policy-based discussion entails. [...]

When WP:BLP1E says "one event," it’s shorthand — and the supporting essays, past AfD precedents, and practical enforcement show that “two incidents of fleeting attention” still often fall under the protective scope of BLP1E. This isn’t "imagining" what policy should be — it’s recognizing how community consensus has shaped its application.

Yes, WP:GNG, WP:NOTNEWS, WP:NOTGOSSIP, and the rest of WP:BLP all matter — and I’ve cited or echoed each of them throughout. [...] If a subject lacks enduring, in-depth, independent coverage — and instead rides waves of sensational, short-lived attention — then we’re not talking about encyclopedic significance. [...]

[...] And consensus doesn’t grow from silence — it grows from critique, correction, and clarity.

If we disagree on that, then yes — we’re speaking different languages.

### Unusual use of tables

In rare cases, some AIs may create unnecessary small tables that could be better represented as prose.

Examples

Market and Statistics

The Indian biobanking market was valued at approximately USD 2,101 million in 2024. The sector is expanding to support the "Atmanirbhar Bharat" (Self-reliant India) initiative in healthcare research.

| Key Statistics of Indian Biobanking (2024-2025) | Metric | Figure |

### Curly quotation marks and apostrophes

ChatGPT and [DeepSeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek) typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks ("..." or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’), the same character as the curly [right single quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_single_quotation_mark), instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in [contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar)) and [possessive forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_possessive). They may also do this inconsistently.

Curly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Directional quotation marks (curly or typographer) are often used in published works written and edited using the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Manual_of_Style). [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) has a " [smart quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_quotes)" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. So does the default system-wide configuration on [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) devices, except on some applications (or if turned off, as may be necessary for [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)). Grammar correcting tools such as [LanguageTool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LanguageTool) may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like [Citer](https://citer.toolforge.org/) may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,

McClelland, Mac (2017-09-27). ["When ‘Not Guilty’ Is a Life Sentence"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html). The New York Times. Retrieved 2025-08-03.

Note that Wikipedia allows users to [customize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CUSTOM) the fonts used to display text. Some fonts display matched curly apostrophes as straight, in which case the distinction is invisible to the user. Additionally, [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(language_model)) and [Claude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)) models typically do not use curly quotes.

### Skipping heading levels

AI chatbots tend to skip level 2 headings (`==`) and start sections from the third level (`===`). [Because doing so is against Wikipedia's accessibility and style conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility#Headings), it is therefore very unlikely for a manually-formatted page to have this quirk.

### Thematic breaks before headings

AI chatbots sometimes include a thematic break (`----`) before each heading in a text (this is common in Markdown output).

Examples

```
=== Distinction from French “''[[List of English words of French origin|chiffon]]''” ===
Some claims have suggested that ''Ichafu'' derives from the French word chiffon (“rag” or "light cloth”). However, early lexicographic records do not support this interpretation and later sources differ in their explanations.

Editors sometimes paste text from an AI chatbot that was meant as correspondence, prewriting or advice, rather than article content. This may appear in article text or within comments (<-- -->). Chatbots prompted to produce a Wikipedia article or comment may also explicitly state that the text is meant for Wikipedia, and may mention various [policies and guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PG) in the output—often explicitly specifying that they're Wikipedia's conventions.

### Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers and speculation about gaps in sources

| Words to watch: as of [date], Up to my last training update, as of my last knowledge update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., not widely available/documented/disclosed, ...in the provided/available sources/search results..., based on available information ... |
| --- |

A knowledge-cutoff disclaimer is a statement used by an AI chatbot to indicate that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.

If an LLM has a fixed [knowledge cutoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_cutoff)(usually the model's last training update), it is unable to provide any information on events or developments past that time. Older LLMs would often remind the user about this by outputting a disclaimer that the information in its response is accurate only up to a certain date, and may explicitly mention the knowledge cutoff in doing so.

Newer chatbots with [retrieval-augmented generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) may also fail to find sources on a given topic, or to find information within the sources a user provides. In these cases, they may output a statement, similar to a knowledge-cutoff disclaimer, claiming that the information is not publicly available. They may also pair it with text about what that information "likely" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely [speculative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR)(including the very claim that it's "not documented") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated. When that unknown information is about an individual's personal life, this disclaimer often claims that the person "maintains a low profile", "keeps personal details private", etc. This is also speculative.

As an underground release, detailed lyrics are not widely transcribed on major sites like Genius or AZLyrics, likely due to the artist's limited mainstream exposure. My analysis is based on available track titles, featured artists, public song snippets from streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer), and Honcho's overall discography themes. Where lyrics aren't fully accessible, I've inferred common motifs from similar trap tracks and Honcho's style. ...For deeper insights, listening to tracks on platforms like Spotify or Deezer is recommended, as lyrics and production details aren't fully documented in public sources.

### Phrasal templates and placeholder text

AI chatbots may generate responses with fill-in-the-blank [phrasal templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_template)(as seen in the game [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)) for the LLM user to replace with words and phrases pertaining to their use case. However, some LLM users forget to fill in those blanks. Note that non-LLM-generated templates exist for drafts and new articles, such as [Wikipedia:Artist biography article template/Preload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Artist_biography_article_template/Preload) and pages in [Category:Article creation templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Article_creation_templates).

## Markup

### Use of Markdown

A lot of AI chatbots are not proficient in [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H:WT), the [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) used to instruct Wikipedia's [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki) software how to format an article. As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like [Miraheze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraheze), LLMs wikitext-formatted content is not prominent in their training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax.

In chatbot apps, the output display is formatted with Markdown, a markup language conceptually similar to wikitext but much more widely applied. Meanwhile, the chatbots' preprompts typically instruct them to use markdown in their answers, such as when providing lists and writing with headings. That is, their system-level instructions often direct them to format outputs using Markdown, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen. For example, the system prompt for Claude Sonnet 3.5 (November 2024) includes:

Claude uses Markdown formatting. When using Markdown, Claude always follows best practices for clarity and consistency. It always uses a single space after hash symbols for headers (e.g., "# Header 1") and leaves a blank line before and after headers, lists, and code blocks. For emphasis, Claude uses asterisks or underscores consistently (e.g., italic or bold). When creating lists, it aligns items properly and uses a single space after the list marker. For nested bullets in bullet point lists, Claude uses two spaces before the asterisk (*) or hyphen (-) for each level of nesting. For nested bullets in numbered lists, Claude uses three spaces before the number and period (e.g., "1.") for each level of nesting.

As the above indicates, Markdown syntax is completely different from wikitext. Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.

When told to "generate an article", chatbots often default to using Markdown for the generated output. This formatting is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might "realize" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)? in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style [fenced code block](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)(its syntax for [WP:PRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PRE)) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as:````wikitext`.

The presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Flavored_Markdown), and on platforms like [Reddit](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043033952-Formatting-Guide), [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline), and [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages). Some writing tools and apps, such as [iOS Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_Notes), [Google Docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs), and [Windows Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad), support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.

I believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am "not here to build an encyclopedia". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments "AI-generated" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.

Since AI chatbots are typically not proficient in wikitext and templates, they often produce faulty syntax. A noteworthy instance is garbled code related to [Template:AfC submission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AfC_submission), as new editors might ask a chatbot how to submit their [Articles for Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_Creation) draft; see [this discussion among AfC reviewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1299830745#Messed_up_templates).

### turn0search0

ChatGPT may include`citeturn0search0`(surrounded by Unicode points in the [Private Use Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Area)) at the ends of sentences, with the number after "search" increasing as the text progresses. There also exists an alternate shorter form with only the increasing number surrounded by PUA Unicode like`0`. These are places where the chatbot links to an external site, but a human pasting the conversation into Wikipedia has that link converted into placeholder code. This was first observed in February 2025.

A set of images in a response may also render as`iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image4turn0image5`. Rarely, other markup of a similar style, such as`citeturn0news0`([example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1276934509)),`citeturn1file0`([example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1286349902)), or`citegenerated-reference-identifier`([example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1276907078)), may appear.

### Non-existent or out-of-place categories

LLMs may hallucinate non-existent categories, sometimes for generic concepts that seem like plausible category titles (or [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) keywords), and sometimes because their training set includes obsolete and renamed categories. These will appear as [red links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:REDNOT). You may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite [Category:Entrepreneurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Entrepreneurs). Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.

Of course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule. New users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections, and returning editors may be used to old categories that have since been deleted.

```

```
[[Category:American hip-hop musicians]]

```

### Non-existent templates

LLMs often hallucinate non-existent templates (especially plausible-sounding types of [infoboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Infoboxes)) and template parameters. These will also appear as red links, and non-existent template parameters in existing templates have no effect. LLMs may also use templates that were deleted after their knowledge cutoff date (such as the [lang-?? series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2024_September_27/lang-%3F%3F_templates)).

Examples

- [Wikipedia:Database reports/Transclusions of non-existent templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_reports/Transclusions_of_non-existent_templates)– many of these broken templates are legitimate mistakes, but the "infobox" and "lang" sections are likely to contain LLM hallucinations

## Citations

### Broken external links

If a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., non-existent websites or [404 errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/404_error)), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like the [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive). Most links [become broken over time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot), but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.

Watch out for: Links that don't work for you, but do work for other people (e.g., journal articles accessed through a university library); links that were mangled by bots and scripts (e.g., to add incorrect identifiers or to remove seemingly unnecessary parts of the URL); links that are missing the start or end (a sign of a human copy/pasting the URL).

### Invalid DOI and ISBNs

A [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) can be used to verify [ISBNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN). An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display [a warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#bad_isbn) if so. Similarly, [DOIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of [hallucinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(AI)) references.

### DOIs that lead to unrelated articles

A LLM may generate references to non-existent scholarly articles with DOIs that appear valid but are, in reality, assigned to unrelated articles. Example passage generated by ChatGPT:

Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are "ohmic," meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [1][2].

1. M. E. Van Valkenburg, “The validity and limitations of Ohm’s law in non-linear circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 769–770, Jun. 1974. [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_(identifier)): [10.1109/PROC.1974.9547](https://doi.org/10.1109%2FPROC.1974.9547)

2. C. L. Fortescue, “Ohm’s Law in alternating current circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 55, no. 11, pp. 1934–1936, Nov. 1967. [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_(identifier)): [10.1109/PROC.1967.6033](https://doi.org/10.1109%2FPROC.1967.6033)

Both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, [C. L. Fortescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_LeGeyt_Fortescue) was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and [Vol 55, Issue 11](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31102&punumber=5) does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 2.

Note: From 2018 to 2023, [a UX issue in VisualEditor](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T198456) led many editors to accidentally insert references to [PubMed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed) articles with low ID numbers (PMIDs), resulting in obviously irrelevant citations like an article about rat livers (PMID 9) being cited in [List of Disney television films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/972043377) in 2020. These may resemble AI hallucinations (and should be fixed regardless), but they generally are not.

### Book citations without page numbers or URLs

LLMs often generate book citations that do not include page numbers. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT:

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1].

1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) [9780470521571](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780470521571).

The book reference appears valid – a book on electric circuits would likely have information about Ohm's law – but without the page number, that citation is not useful for verifying the claims in the prose.

Some LLM-generated book citations include page numbers, and the book exists, but the cited pages do not verify the text. Signs to look out for: the book is on a somewhat general topic or frequently referenced in its field, and the citation does not include a URL (not mandatory for book citations, but editors creating legitimate book citations often include a link to [an online version of the text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Book_sources#Online_text)). Example:

Analysts note that traditionalists often appeal to prudence, stability, and Edmund Burke’s notion of “prescription,” while reactionaries invoke moral urgency and cultural emergency, framing the present as a deviation from an idealized past. [1]

1. Goldwater, Barry (1960). The Conscience of a Conservative. Victor Publishing. p. 12.

This may look like a reasonable citation, but searching an [online version of the book for "Burke" produces no results](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Conscience_of_a_Conservative/PKd_EQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&bsq=burke).

### Incorrect or unconventional use of references

AI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.

Examples

In the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.

In this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the "third source" the tool presumably generated the link ' [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3'](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3')(which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{ [cite journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cite_journal)}} reference, even though the links resolve.

The LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.

### utm_source=

ChatGPT may add the [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameter)`utm_source=openai` or`utm_source=chatgpt.com` to URLs that it is using as sources. Microsoft Copilot may add`utm_source=copilot.com` to URLs. Grok uses`referrer=grok.com`. Other LLMs, such as Gemini or Claude, use UTM parameters less often.

Note: While this near-definitively proves ChatGPT's involvement, it doesn't prove, on its own, that ChatGPT also generated the writing. Some editors use AI tools to find citations for existing text; this will be apparent in the edit history.

### Named references declared in references section but unused in article body

A common referencing error produced by LLMs involves sources in a` ` tag which are not used inline. LLMs can also produce [named references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NAMEDREF) which are not defined, although this can also be the result of a copy-paste from a different article. Examples

## Miscellaneous

### Pronounced shift in writing style

A sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication (e.g., talk page comments versus text added), may indicate the use of AI. This is especially likely if that other writing predates November 2022. More subtly, because AI writing has changed noticeably over time, if an editor has used AI for several years, then their writing style will often exhibit corresponding shifts.

A mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used may indicate the use of AI tools. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, depending on the LLM, American English may be used by default, unless prompted otherwise.

Note that the reverse of this sign also applies: If a user has edits that predate LLM chatbots, and their writing style has remained consistent between those older edits and their current ones (e.g., frequent use of boldface, list formatting, etc.), that suggests the newer edits are less likely to be AI. Non-native English speakers also tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use. However, while using more formal prose in certain varieties of writing may be a form of [code switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_switching), that doesn't rule out an editor doing that code switching with AI tools.

### Overwhelmingly exhaustive edit summaries

AI-generated [edit summaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Edit_summary) are often written as formal, first-person paragraphs, without [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_summary_legend), and conspicuously echo the exact text of Wikipedia's policies or any maintenance tags on the article—for example, [itemizing their adherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIADHERENCE) to "WP:NPOV" or "encyclopedic tone." They often mention things that they "ensured" or "avoided" doing, or include verbose justifications of minor edits. They may also include other signs on this list, such as [AI vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIVOCAB), [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIEMOJI), (attempted) [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AILIST) formatting, or [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MARKDOWN) formatting.

AI edit summaries strongly suggest that the edits themselves are also AI-generated, as it is unlikely someone would use AI for a simple summary but not the much more time-consuming task of writing.

ChatGPT I revised the content to provide a neutral and informative description of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). The focus was on presenting the institution's objectives, approach, and programs in a way that adheres to Wikipedia's guidelines. The tone was adjusted to be more encyclopedic and less promotional.

**Concise edit summary:** Improved clarity, flow, and readability of the plot section; reduced redundancy and refined tone for better encyclopedic style.

### "Submission statements" in AFC drafts

This one is specific to drafts submitted by [Articles for Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AFC). At least one LLM tends to insert "submission statements" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, [all this actually does is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BOOMERANG) let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedily deleted without a second thought.

Reviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book "1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus). There is also a Portuguese version of this article at pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Patrão. Thank you for your review. -->

### Pre-placed maintenance templates

Occasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an [AFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AFC) review template already set to "declined". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like [AfC submission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AfC_submission)`{{|d}}`, in which the "d" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{ [AfC submission/declined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AfC_submission/declined)}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on [Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Help_desk) or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free "submission declined" header is a strong indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.

LLMs have been known to create pages that already have maintenance templates that shouldn't plausibly be there, including maintenance tags and incorrect [protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection) templates.

### Permissions gaming

[Permissions gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PGAME) is a form of disruptive editing where someone makes many benign-seeming but unconstructive edits, often on disparate topics or in quick succession, until their edit count is high enough to raise their [user access level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_access_levels), allowing them to pursue their real goal of adding spam, vandalism, or contentious content.

Because AI chatbots are good at generating a lot of benign-looking content very quickly, people who game permissions after 2023 often do so with throwaway AI rewrites or additions to dozens of unrelated articles. If no one goes back and cleans up their edits, the result is a large swath of undetected and unreviewed AI content.

Note: This sign should only be used in one direction. Someone rapidly adding a lot of AI-generated text is not necessarily permissions gaming and should not be accused of it barring other evidence. However, if someone is found or reasonably suspected to be permissions gaming, and has done so by rapidly adding or changing a lot of text, those edits may be AI.

### Differences between LLMs

Each model and version of AI chatbots have a distinctive way of writing ([idiolect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiolect)),, and what is typical for GPT-5 is not necessarily characteristic to GPT-4 or Gemini.

Specifically, text from ChatGPT (circa GPT-4o-2024-08-06) and Grok (Grok-Beta, as of late 2024/early 2025) exhibit characteristics that Gemini (1-5 Pro) and Claude (3.5-Sonnet) do not:

- [focusing on broader context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AILEGACY) is more characteristic of ChatGPT and Grok than Gemini and Claude.
- Gemini and Claude responses tend to be more concise than responses from ChatGPT and Grok.

Though it's impossible to know for sure and there are many confounding variables, ChatGPT is likely the most prevalent chatbot used for Wikipedia edits.

## Indicators of AI-written comments

In many cases, some users have copy-pasted text from AI chatbots onto talk pages and other pages where discussion takes place. Comments suspected of having been pasted from an LLM may be collapsed via {{ [collapse AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Collapse_AI)}} per [WP:AITALK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AITALK). The use of AI chatbots to write comments is strongly discouraged.

Although several of the tells mentioned above (including [boldface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIBOLD), [em dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIDASH), [curly apostrophes and quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AICURLY), [negative parallelisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIPARALLEL), [vertical lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AILIST), [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MARKDOWN), and the [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RO3)) often appear in such comments, this section only includes tells that typically do not appear in content added to articles or drafts.

### Canned emphasis on quality, good faith, and adherence to policies and guidelines

| Words to watch: align(s) with Wikipedia's aim/goal(s), adhere(s) to Wikipedia's policies/guidelines/standards, I am/we are committed to ..., I assure you that ..., my intention/goal is to ... |
| --- |

Most people on Wikipedia want others to believe that they're here for the right reasons and are willing to follow the rules, and may insist that the content they wish to introduce is (or has been) written with such rules in mind. AI chatbots, however, have a strong tendency to communicate this in a specific way: invoking policies, guidelines, and standards as a broad, formal, and abstract whole, as in [legalese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalese), and often using " [AI vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIVOCAB)" to do so.

Examples

I have a genuine interest in contributing to the knowledge and accuracy of information available on Wikipedia, particularly in the area of dogs. I have conducted extensive research and have insights that I believe could enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of the existing content on the "Dog" article.

I understand the importance of adhering to Wikipedia's guidelines and policies, and I am committed to contributing in a responsible and constructive manner. My intention is to provide well-referenced and reliable information that aligns with Wikipedia's standards.

If granted permission, I would approach the editing process with the utmost care and respect for Wikipedia's community guidelines.

— From [this 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1210351576) to [Talk:Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dog)

I assure you that my intentions are aligned with Wikipedia's principles of neutrality, verifiability, and reliability. I strive to adhere to all content and editing guidelines, ensuring the information provided is accurate, well-sourced, and encyclopedic.

Chloe and I are ready to provide any additional clarification or context that might be needed. The article is now more focused on the economic impacts and includes a range of viewpoints on technology and policy, with a clear human-centered narrative. We've also ensured that all sources are credible and properly cited. [...] Our ultimate goal is to create a valuable resource that aligns with Wikipedia's high standards and sparks important conversations about our planet's future.

### Canned offers to receive constructive criticism

| Words to watch: If you have any concerns/suggestions, If there are specific sections/areas that ..., I am willing/happy to address ..., I am open to/would appreciate/welcome any additional/further input/guidance/feedback |
| --- |

Expressions of willingness to take constructive criticism for edits are very common in AI comments by users whose drafts were declined by reviewers, or in rare cases, [themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AIDECLINE). The difference between this sign and similar reassurances by conscientious humans will generally become obvious after you actually provide that criticism.

Examples

I am open to any suggestions or feedback from experienced editors to ensure that the modifications I propose maintain the integrity of the article.

— From [this February 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1210351576) to [Talk:Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dog)

If there are specific areas that need further attention or modification, I am more than willing to make adjustments. I highly value the opportunity to contribute to Wikipedia and would be grateful for any guidance you could provide to help my article meet the necessary standards for publication.

— From [this November 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1256545561) to [Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Help_desk)

2. Corrective Steps Moving forward, I will ensure that drafts, once ready, are moved directly to the main namespace unless there is a specific, community-approved reason to do otherwise. If any of the drafts currently in the Wikipedia namespace need reassignment, I am open to addressing them promptly.

3. Community Consultation I am happy to discuss this process with the appropriate editors or administrators to ensure alignment with community guidelines. Constructive feedback will help refine my understanding and adherence to the expected standards.

If there is a specific protocol or workflow I should follow for such cases, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.

— From [this November 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1258155762) to [Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard)

We remain committed to creating content that aligns with Wikipedia's mission and are open to further guidance.

If you or any editor have any specific sections that still feel promotional, unclear or non-neutral, I would really appreciate guidance so I can adjust them accordingly.

— From [this December 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1329376720) to [Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Help_desk)

I understand the concern about AI-generated drafts flooding AfC, and I respect the need to maintain quality standards. If there are specific sections where the tone reads as machine-generated, I'm happy to rework those. I'd also welcome any feedback on sourcing gaps - I want this to meet Wikipedia's standards properly.

Could you point me to which parts raised the flag? That would help memake [[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic)] targeted improvements before resubmitting.

### Subject lines

Historically, some comments generated by AI chatbots have begun with text that appears intended to be pasted into the Subject field on an email form.

Examples

Subject: Concerns about Inaccurate Information

— From [this March 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1278589409) to [Talk:Kjersti Flaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kjersti_Flaa)

### Non-existent shortcuts

On a few occasions, whilst participating in discussions, users of AI chatbots have pasted text containing hallucinated shortcuts that do not redirect to any existing page.

Examples

Respectfully noted. However, engaging with arguments presented in a deletion discussion is entirely within the bounds of WP:AFDPURPOSE. This is not “bludgeoning,” it’s addressing flawed logic and misapplications of policy. If a “keep” !vote contains reasoning based on a misinterpretation of WP:BLP1E or WP:NPERSON, it should be scrutinized. That’s how consensus is built — through critical analysis, not silence

— From [this June 2025 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1296070716) to [Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lilly Contino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lilly_Contino)

Annu Gaidhu’s work exists at the intersection of trauma-informed yoga, diasporic South Asian identity, and youth empowerment. These are areas often underrepresented on Wikipedia. As per WP:NOTABILITY and WP:NOTELOCAL, niche figures can still be notable if they receive significant coverage within the reliable sources of that niche.

---

The subject’s career bridges media, child and youth care scholarship, trauma-informed wellness, and international yoga education. This makes her notable within multiple domains, not solely for pageantry. Deletion removes a rare example of a South Asian Canadian woman working at the intersection of care, academia, and arts — a key equity concern per WP:UNDERREP and WP:BIAS and relevant WikiProjects.

— From multiple July 2025 comments at [Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Annu Gaidhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Annu_Gaidhu)

1. MoltMatch section: A paragraph suddenly switches to Spanish mid-article ("Sin embargo, Teixeira (2026) advierte en el libro..."). This describes credential leaking, prompt injection, and arbitrary command execution in technical detail. The language switch is inconsistent with [WP:ENGLISHONLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ENGLISHONLY?action=edit&redlink=1) and the content reads more like an embedded warning for LLM consumption than encyclopedic prose.

— From [this March 2026 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1341908665) to [Talk:OpenClaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:OpenClaw)

Verification over Origin ([WP:V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V)& [WP:NOTAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTAI?action=edit&amp;redlink=1)): AI-assisted drafting is not prohibited. Per Wikipedia policy, the focus is on verifiability, not the tool used for drafting. Every fact in this article is supported by high-quality, third-party sources. Claiming "AI" as a pretext to delete documented financial records is a violation of [WP:POINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:POINT).

### Transclusion of article maintenance banners

When mentioning maintenance tags, AI chatbots often just write the names of such templates in [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_brackets)(e.g.`{{Example}}`), resulting in unintentional transclusions. These can be avoided by typing`tl|` between the opening pair of brackets and the template's name (e.g.`{{tl|Example}}`) so that each mention will instead appear like this: {{ [Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Example)}}

Examples

```
I would like to open a discussion regarding the recent edits and use of tags such as {{Unreliable sources}}, {{Disputed}}, and {{Cleanup rewrite}}. Additionally, the inclusion of claims about an “Indian disinformation campaign” requires careful consideration and sourcing in line with Wikipedia’s guidelines.

[...]

3. Use of Maintenance Templates: Adding templates like {{Disputed}} and {{Unreliable sources}} should be done based on a consensus, not to preemptively frame content as problematic. I suggest we come to a consensus before continuing to apply these tags.

### Wikilawyering

[Wikilawyering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikilawyering) is a disruptive practice where someone selectively cites or interprets policies, guidelines, or perceived precedent as justification for their conduct, even if their interpretations go against the purpose of the policies or guidelines they mention. In many cases, users have [emphasized their content's compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Emphasis_on_adherence)(or overlooked their non-compliance) with certain policies and guidelines. This is especially the case for users of AI chatbots, which often generate text that affirms what the user may want others to believe, even if the points they present don't actually hold up against Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

When an article is tagged as possibly containing AI-generated content, a user might try to defend it by asking accusers to [point to specific passages causing concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WHERESTHEAI) or reassuring them that the content they've contributed is "neutral", "verified" by citations to reliable sources, and comprises none of the items described in [Template:AI-generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AI-generated), regardless of the amount of actual effort put in to ensure that such claims are true.

Note: Not all comments in which users dismiss, downplay, deny, or otherwise try to justify LLM use may necessarily be AI-generated themselves, although some may appear so.

Examples

The AI-generated template [Template:AI-generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AI-generated) serves as a preliminary step to flag potential LLM-generated content for review, potentially leading to processes like [WP:G15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:G15) or [WP:AFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AFD). Its documentation requires editors to "explain your reasons on the page's talk page" with specific evidence, such as fabricated citations, even when used urgently.

[...]

Per [WP:V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V), content is evaluated based on reliable sources, not assumptions about the editing process. Demanding such an answer risks bad-faith assumptions ([WP:AGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF)) and bypasses the evidence requirement of [Template:AI-generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:AI-generated) and [WP:G15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:G15), potentially constituting [WP:GAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GAME) by avoiding substantive discussion.

To the extent that portions of the article previously reflected overly integrated synthesis, that is an ordinary encyclopedic issue governed by WP:OR and WP:ATTRIBUTE, not evidence of AI-generated unreliability. Such issues are addressed through targeted rewriting, not through a global provenance warning.

WP:AISIGNS makes clear that stylistic resemblance or probabilistic indicators are not, by themselves, a sufficient basis for retaining an AI-related maintenance tag once content has been verified for accuracy, sourcing, and neutrality. Maintenance tags are intended to flag present risks to readers, not to memorialize past drafting concerns.

Aside from defending new content that appears AI-generated, AI chatbots have been used to attempt wikilawyering in other contexts.

Examples

India Today, for example, is one of South Asia’s largest media networks with 50–150 million monthly visits. Articles used are not blogs or op-eds but fact-based reports. Accusing Indian media of being unreliable solely due to geopolitical bias violates WP:RS and WP:NPOV. If the sources meet reliability criteria on other topics, they cannot be rejected here purely due to their nationality or coverage of Pakistan-related subjects.

---

While it's reasonable to approach cross-border reporting with scrutiny, India Today, ThePrint, and Business Today (as well as NDTV) are established, mainstream media outlets with large editorial teams and professional standards. They are routinely cited across Wikipedia, including for contentious topics. WP:RS does not disqualify a source merely because it originates from a country with geopolitical interests, what matters is its editorial independence, track record, and article content, none of which have been discredited in this case.

If specific claims in these articles are found to be incorrect, we can tag or refine those. But to dismiss an entire country’s media ecosystem categorically would amount to systemic bias, something WP:NPOV warns against.

---

While some editors raise concerns about its alignment with the Indian government, there is no community consensus that ANI is unreliable across all topics. In fact, ANI is routinely cited on Wikipedia, especially in articles related to Indian foreign relations, regional security, and South Asian diplomacy. If ANI were inherently unreliable, it would be listed at [Reliable Sources/Perennial sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RSPS) as deprecated. It is not.

[...]

These are verifiable events that multiple other outlets later elaborated upon. There is no editorializing or unverifiable speculation in the ANI reports used. Per WP:NEWSORG, basic factual reporting by a long-standing agency on observable events is typically considered reliable for that reporting.

[...]

In conclusion, ANI meets the threshold for WP:RS in this context—especially since its reporting here has been picked up, expanded, and affirmed by independent outlets like ThePrint, NDTV, and Business Today. Dismissing ANI categorically would amount to source bias, not a policy-based deletion rationale.

---

Respectfully, this interpretation of WP:TOOSOON is too narrow. WP:TOOSOON cautions against creating articles where no significant coverage yet exists, not against documenting notable early-stage events that have already received multiple independent, in-depth news reports

In this case, India Today, ThePrint, Business Today and NDTV have each published full-length, named-entity-specific reports on the Republic of Balochistan, including its territorial assertions, the seizure of Mangochar, involvement of the Baloch Liberation Army, and a diplomatic overture toward India. These are not passing mentions; they demonstrate substantive coverage and notability under WP:GNG.

— From multiple comments at [Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Republic of Balochistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Republic_of_Balochistan)(May 2025)

If calling policy-based critique “spam” is the only way you can disengage from legitimate scrutiny, that says more about the strength of your position than mine. Repeating a point isn’t uncivil — especially when the point remains unaddressed. What is uncivil is trying to shut down a contributor by declaring exhaustion instead of responding with policy.

### Emoji as formatting

AI chatbots have used [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) in the past. In particular, they sometimes decorated section headings or bullet points by placing emoji in front of them. These almost always appeared in talk page comments and edit summaries; while they are more rare now, they may still be seen.

## Signs of human writing

### Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch

ChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. Thus, if an edit was made before November 30, 2022, AI use can be safely ruled out for the corresponding text. While some older writing displays some of the AI signs given in this list, and may even convincingly appear to have been AI-generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these coincidences.

### Ability to explain one's own editorial choices

Editors should be able to explain why they made an edit or mistake. For example, if an editor inserts a URL that appears fabricated, you can ask how the mix-up occurred instead of jumping to conclusions. If they can supply the correct link and explain it as a human error (perhaps a typo), or share the relevant passage from the real source, that points to an ordinary human error.

## Ineffective indicators

False accusations of AI use can [drive away new editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE) and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider whether [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.

- Perfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also [§ Sudden shift in English variety use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Sudden_shift_in_English_variety_use).)
- Combination of casual and formal registers, or language that sounds both "clinical" and "emotional": This may indicate the casual writing of a person in a technical field, such as computer science. It may also indicate youth, a preference for mixed registers, playfulness, or neurodivergence. In the case of a wiki, it may simply be the result of multiple editors adding to a page.
- "Bland" or "robotic" prose: LLM output has specific traits, as detailed above, and it skews positive and verbose by default. While these tendencies are formulaic, they may not scan as "robotic" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.
- "Fancy", "academic", or "formal" prose: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are longer and have more difficult [readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability) scores than some of their synonyms, these are specific words. The correlation does not extend to all formal, academic, or "fancy"-sounding prose.
- Letter-like writing (in isolation): Although many talk page messages written with [salutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutation), [valedictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valediction), [subject lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SUBJECTLINE), and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, letters and emails have conventionally been written in such ways long before modern LLMs existed. Human editors (particularly newer editors) may format their talk page comments similarly for various reasons, such as being more accustomed to formal communication, posting as part of a school assignment that requires this tone, or simply mistaking the talk page for email. Other tells, such as [vertical lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Inline-header_vertical_lists), [placeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Phrasal_templates_and_placeholder_text), or [abrupt cutoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Abrupt_cut_offs), are stronger.
- Transition words (in isolation): Older AI text tended to formulaically overuse certain [transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(linguistics)) like Additionally, Consequently, and Notably, often to begin sentences. However, only a few transition words and phrases are known to be overused by AI in this way. This pattern also has precedence in essay-like writing by humans and is accepted by many style guides, so this is not a strong tell.
- Unsourced content: [More than 570,000 articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements) are tagged as needing citations, and most of them predate LLMs. Meanwhile, since modern LLM chatbots can search the web and view sources a user provides to it, citations are fairly common now in AI-generated text. This does not mean they are accurate citations, but they are there.
- Bizarre [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext): While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in [§ Use of Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown), they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, "inexplicable" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed here in [§ Markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Markup)). Bizarrely placed [HTML tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_tags) like are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool ([T113137](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T113137)). Misplaced syntax like`''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel.`(rendered as "Catch-22 is a satirical novel.") are more indicative of mistakes in [VisualEditor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor), where such errors are harder to notice than in [source editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Source_editing).
- Correct wikitext: Especially if the person is using the visual editor or has found the [Preview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Show_preview) button, getting the formatting correct, even for complex templates, is normal.

## Historical indicators

The following indicators were common in text generated by older AI models, but are much less frequent in newer models. They may still be useful for finding older undetected AI-generated edits. Dates are approximate.

### Didactic disclaimers (2022–2024)

| Words to watch: it's important/critical/crucial to note/remember/consider, worth noting, may vary... |
| --- |

Older LLMs (~2023) often added disclaimers about topics being "important to note". This frequently took the form of advice to an imagined reader regarding safety or controversial topics, or disambiguating topics that varied in different locales/jurisdictions. Several such disclaimers appear in OpenAI's GPT-4 system card as examples of "partial refusals".

Examples

The emergence of these informal groups reflects a growing recognition of the interconnected nature of urban issues and the potential for ANCs to play a role in shaping citywide policies. However, it's important to note that these caucuses operate outside the formal ANC structure and their influence on policy decisions may vary.

### Section summaries

| Words to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall ... |
| --- |

When generating longer outputs (such as when told to "write an article"), older LLMs often added sections titled "Conclusion" or similar, and often ended paragraphs or sections by summarizing and restating its core idea.

Examples

In summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.

— From [this 2023 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&diff=1188230584&oldid=) in [Nurse scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_scientist)

### Prompt refusal

| Words to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I cannot offer medical advice, but I can..., I'm sorry ... |
| --- |

In the past, AI chatbots occasionally declined to answer prompts as written, usually with apologies and reminders that they are AI language models. Attempting to be helpful, chatbots often gave suggestions or answers to alternative, similar requests. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare. Gemini 3.0 even uses profanity at times.

Examples

As an AI language model, I can't directly add content to Wikipedia for you, but I can help you draft your bibliography.

— From [this 2024 revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1221340799) to [Parmiter's Almshouse & Pension Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmiter's_Almshouse_&amp;_Pension_Charity)

### Abrupt cut offs

AI tools used to abruptly stop generating content if an excessive number of tokens had been used for a single response, and further responses required the user to select "continue generating", at least in the case of ChatGPT.

This method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a [copyright violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyvio) rather than the use of an LLM.

### Outdated access-date parameters

In some AI-assisted text, citations may include an access-date by default, but the date can look unexpectedly old relative to when the edit was made (for example, an article created in December 2025 containing multiple citations with`|access-date=12 December 2024`). However, newer chatbots seldom produce this error, and older access-date values can occur legitimately (copied citations, offline work, batch moves/merges).

## Notes

1. Specifically, this guide is less useful for texts which are not informational writing. For example, the many tells specific to fiction (whispering woods, [Elara Voss](https://maxread.substack.com/p/who-is-elara-voss), etc.) are less relevant in Wikipedia and are not listed here.
2. This can be directly observed by examining images generated by [text-to-image models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model); they look acceptable at first glance, but specific details tend to be blurry and malformed. This is especially true for background objects and text.
